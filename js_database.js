Cutting and trimming fabric to make clothes can be a good job, but it is a brilliant way of expressing your uniqueness, charm, and creativity. Words cannot express the sense of accomplishment when you have gathered the necessary materials and produced the desired piece of clothing. First, you need a Tailoring Kit and tailoring materials such as Cloth and Finishing Thread. Refer to a Sewing Pattern to make the clothing you want. The necessary materials will vary depending on the Sewing Pattern to be used. Finishing Thread is used for the final needlework."},

This naturally led to creating lighter garments which can be made in a less dangerous way. The Weaving skill allows you to create thread from natural resources such as wool to weave fabric. In order to learn and effectively use the Weaving skill, you must have an eye for detail and put in your most sincere efforts. While these are difficult criteria to accomplish, knowing that many people are able to create beautiful garments with the fabric that you have weaved using the Weaving skill will be quite fulfilling. Remember that you require tools such as Spinning Wheels and Looms to use the skill."},

In order to do this, one must be equipped with nimble hands, a thorough understanding of the materials, and a high level of concentration required to catch just the right combination of items for maximum effect. Explaining all this to everyone hoping to create something from scratch is a difficult task, however. Adding all these up, people began to call this knowledge the Handicraft skill. To anyone that desires to create something from scratch, this skill may be a godsend."},

Not only does it make it difficult to build metal products of adequate quality, it is also difficult to produce even any results. Therefore, in order to use metal, a process in which pure metal is gained from ore is essential. This is where the Refining skill comes in. Through this skill, you can gain pure metal ingots or bars from ore. Do note that you can only use this skill when there is a Furnace to melt the ore in."},

There are exceptional cases of the uninitiated in Herbalism successfully gathering herbs by luck. However, gathering herbs is a very delicate process and beginners in Herbalism can often ruin intact herbs. Rare herbs tend to grow only in the deepest regions of a dungeon and, therefore, you should regularly study the different kinds of herbs and practice a careful gathering skill."},

You can easily start fishing with Fishing Rod and Bait, but you need more than that to fish even better. You must know how to adequately attach the Bait, have the judgment to choose a good place, and have the patience to wait until a fish is caught once all the preparations is done. Once fish is caught, you must control the single fishing line and quickly snatch it up as the fish will challenge you with its strength. This is why many people refer to experienced fishermen as the masters of life."},

One who mentally organizes the relationship of parts and how these parts combine to form the resulting product will develop patience and tenacity that he didn't have before. This leads to improved Stamina. Production Mastery is a skill that reflects the heart of the maker. The heart of the maker who imagines the completed product has more delicate skill, and his intense desire and imagination leads to successful incarnation of the result in the real world. Making something or discovering in order to make something is the driving force that develops the Production Mastery skill. (But Enchant seems to be in a separate domain.)"},

Various ore fragments are available including Iron, Copper, Silver, Gold, and Mythril, and they can be refined to ingots at Forge in town. This skill has an extremely low chance of discovering Gems whose types vary depending on the weather, time, and location. Gems, repositories of ancient knowledge, can be exchanged with a variety of experience points when they are given to Spirit Weapons. When given to villagers, they elicit various reactions and may be exchanged with gifts."},

sk20001:{cat:"2",	rank:"-3",	pos:"34:66",	type:"Active",	name:{en:"Defense",			ja:"ディフェンス"},			text:"You can protect yourself from any attack of the enemy in close-quarter combat by using this Defense skill. Remember that, while Defense is a way to protect your body, it also lets you retaliate. Successfully defending yourself disrupts the enemy's flow of attacks, opening themselves up to your attack. If you determine that you are on the defensive during a battle due to the one-sided attack of the enemy, you can instantly turn the tide of the battle by using this skill. Don't be discouraged even if your enemy does not lose his flow of attack, but persistently lead him on to spend his energy. After tiring out the enemy, administer a quiet and calm strike. Defense is the most effective preparation for your attacks."},
sk20002:{cat:"2",	rank:"-3",	pos:"98:66",	type:"Active",	name:{en:"Smash",			ja:"スマッシュ"},			text:"At your first opportunity, use the Smash skill to nearby enemies. This powerful attack skill will send them flying. If your enemy repeats the cycle of retreating and defending at your coming onslaught, don't hesitate to seize the battle initiative by using a powerful skill like Smash."},
sk20003:{cat:"2",	rank:"-3",	pos:"66:66",	type:"Active",	name:{en:"Counterattack",	ja:"カウンターアタック"},		text:"Counterattack allows you to turn your opponent's strength against them. This skill will greatly increase your abilities in close-range combat, as you'll be able to reflect almost any attack. The stronger your enemy's attack, the stronger your counterattack becomes. When you're equipped with knuckles, which are usually used by Fighters, you can attack with more agility."},
sk20011:{cat:"2",	rank:"0",	pos:"514:66",	type:"Active",	name:{en:"Charge",			ja:"突進"},				text:"This skill enables you to fiercely charge at an enemy while protecting your vital points. You will receive less damage from long-ranged bow and crossbow attacks, and will not be knocked down. This skill cannot block magic damage from long-ranged attacks. Upon approaching a target, this skill forcefully hits and pushes back the target, causing it to temporarily lose consciousness."},
sk20012:{cat:"2",	rank:"0",	pos:"706:66",	type:"Active",	name:{en:"Assault Slash",			ja:"ダウンアタック"},			text:"A true fighter must never be caught off guard or show mercy. When an enemy falls, that is the moment to strike! Jump high into the air, and crash down, slashing with your sword. Your mighty strike will leave your enemy begging for mercy."},
sk20016:{cat:"2",	rank:"0",	pos:"930:66",	type:"Active",	name:{en:"Lance Counter",		ja:"ランスカウンター"},			text:"One weakness that lances have is that it's hard to attack an enemy that is close to you. Expert lancers, however, developed Lance Counter to compensate. Lance Counter activates faster than a normal Counterattack, but the position is not maintained as long; one must know exactly when the attack is coming to utilize the attack. The attack power of Lance Counter is directly proportionate to the enemy's attack. Definitely a must-have when fighting a powerful enemy."},
sk20017:{cat:"2",	rank:"0",	pos:"994:66",	type:"Active",	name:{en:"Lance Charge",		ja:"ランスチャージ"},			text:"Lance Charge makes the wielder dash fiercely towards the enemy with their lance extended. While charging towards the target, all the enemies in between are knocked back. Although it cannot be used on nearby enemies, it is very effective for both damage and positioning."},
sk20018:{cat:"2",   rank:"0",   pos:"1314:66",   type:"Active",     name:{en:"Rage Impact",       ja:""},  text:"A warrior must not lose their will to fight, even when surrounded. Rage Impact unleashes waves of fighting spirit to overwhelm your opponents and give you the opening to take them down."},

Use the skill to find weaknesses and chain progressively stronger attacks, but be careful of leaving yourself open. Only expert warriors who have undergone arduous training can use this skill efficiently."},
sk21001:{cat:"2",	rank:"-3",	pos:"162:66",	type:"Active",	name:{en:"Ranged Attack",	ja:"レンジアタック"},			text:"Attacking the enemy from a place where his attacks cannot reach you is the easiest way to defeat an enemy. This is an obvious fact, but it's not so simple during actual battle. In a long range attack, a weapon that enables such an attack and the skill to handle that weapon with precision are critical. Containing the basics of long range attacks, learning Ranged Attack enables you to carry out more accurate and powerful attacks from a distance. However, this one thing must not be forgotten - long range attacks are not accomplished by instant mental understanding but through persistent practice and training. The idea of a battle without risks is appealing, but it also requires much preparation and grueling training."},

The enemy wounded by this attack will collapse before they can even approach you. Not only that, even if it only grazes the enemy, this powerful skill will topple the enemy's morale and make them tremble in fear even before starting the battle. If you have reached a point where you can control the tempo in your concentration and the power of your attack, practice delivering a great impact on your target with this skill. This is easier said than done, however."},
sk21004:{cat:"2",	rank:"0",	pos:"258:66",	type:"Active",	name:{en:"Arrow Revolver",		ja:"アローリボルバー"},			text:"The Arrow Revolver skill was invented not by archers but wizards. The idea of loading arrows in advance came from charging Icebolts. For beginners, it would be challenging to load even 2 arrows due to the high tension of the bow string. Thus, loading 5 arrows and maintaining that state would seem mysterious and almost magical to beginners."},
sk21006:{cat:"2",	rank:"0",	pos:"290:66",	type:"Active",	name:{en:"Support Shot",		ja:"サポートショット"},			text:"A common mistake even for proficient archers is to be overly confident in the power of his own arrow so that he steps out of the line in his supporting role. He would then get in the way of the other warriors' battle to death and snatch away their accomplishment. The Support Shot skill allows for the wisdom and discernment to use the bow with the whole battle scene in mind rather than the archer's target. The Support Shot skill is an integral part in the way of a respected archer."},

This skill can potentially incur great damages on a multitude of enemies. The enemy that is hit with the mirage missile falls into a kind of shock state, as if fallen into a mirage in the middle of a sandy desert. The enemy's HP will fall significantly, and infect any others nearby with the same symptoms. As low as the HP may get, however, it will not fall below 1."},

The spirit, once awakened, has the ability to attack multiple targets within a general vicinity. In order for spirits to make attacks however, they must first be awakened, but only spirits with a Social Level of at least 21 can do so. The energy required to awaken the spirit can only be collected a small amount at a time, through using the Spirit Weapon in combat. Only when enough energy has been gathered can this skill then be activated. As soon as the skill is activated, the energy begins to escape though, and since no further energy can be gathered, this skill should only be activated once an appropriate target has been spotted."},

You can defeat the enemy by instantaneously moving in the speed of a sword in the air, which allows you to keep swinging your sword even when you are under attack by the enemy as long as you are holding the sword in both hands. If you are holding a weapon in just one hand, you will be able to blow away your enemy with a single swing in the air."},
