This is an English localized version of the RGT skin, Mabiskillskin
You need the RGT cgi script to use this skin.

More information:
RGT was a guild roster profile system built using perl cgi script, which has been lost to time unless you use the web archive.

mabiskillskin1 was a [Mabinogi](https://mabinogi.nexon.net/) themed skin for RGT, which included all the skill icons, pet icons, some journal information and skill rank information.

The original release (2.30.19) was last updated in 2012, which contained game information of that point in time.

My intention was to translate it to English (via Google translate and the game translation), add to it and use it on my guild website.

Edit:
June 2021 - It's been a long time since I looked at this.
I am writing a somewhat decent readme.md, since the old version just linked to my old blog, which got hacked/deleted and url hijacked.

This version was numbered 2.31.05, according to `mabiskillskin1/js_common.js`
For an overview of the changes made to this unofficial version, please check: `mabiskillskin1/mss_changelog.html`
